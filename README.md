# Learning Lab: Personal learning system



Welcome to the **Learning Lab**! This repo serves as my public learning repo for systematic learning, building, and exploring various engineering technologies(from automating things with python , building passion projects, exploring AI etc ). This repo is not only a record of my personal growth but also a outlet to  showcase my technical capabilities and learning methodologies as I learn, build and grow.

## Main objectives

### Personal Growth
- Organize scattered learning into a structured knowledge system
- Deepen my understanding and memory through actual project building
- Establish a trackable learning rhythm and habits
- Transform my knowledge into capability through notes, summaries, and projects

### Professional Showcase
- Clearly present mastered technologies and tools
- Demonstrate how to analyze and solve complex problems
- Prove continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies
- Reflect structured thinking and system design capabilities
