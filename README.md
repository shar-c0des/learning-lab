  <em>“Practice even what seems impossible. From practice, the unfamiliar becomes second nature.”</em>
  <br>
  — Marcus Aurelius | My structured spot to turn new tech & ideas into skills 
</p>

Welcome to my Learning Lab! This repo is where I organize, build, and explore engineering skills—from Python automation to AI experiments. It’s part personal growth tracker, part showcase of how I turn "I don’t know this" into "I built this."

## 🎯 Main Goals
### For My Growth
- Turn scattered learning into a structured knowledge system
- Deepen understanding by building (not just reading)
- Track progress with consistent, actionable practice
- Turn notes + experiments into usable tools/projects

### For You (to See)
- Clear showcase of mastered tech/tools
- Examples of how I break down complex problems
- Proof of continuous learning (no stagnation here!)
- Glimpse of my structured thinking + system design habits
